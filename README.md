# Material Design Clone
In this application I created a simple UI component library by implementing four form elements from Material Design.

## Running
- Clone repository.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start`.
- Go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## The elements implemented are
- https://material.io/design/components/text-fields.html
- https://material.io/design/components/selection-controls.html#switches
- https://material.io/design/components/selection-controls.html#checkboxes
- https://material.io/design/components/selection-controls.html#radio-buttons
